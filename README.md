## Project Overview

PowerCo, a utility company, is concerned about customer churn within the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) segment. Our goal is to analyze the factors affecting churn, make churn predictions, and develop strategies to reduce churn.

## Data

The project utilizes two main datasets:

- `client_data.csv`: Contains customer-specific information, including margin data, consumption data, and contract history as of January 2016 and whether customers have churned by March 2016.

- `price_data.csv`: Provides historical pricing data for 2015 from January to December for each SME client.
  
For detailed descriptions of these datasets, please refer to the `Data_Description.docx` file.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key phases:

1. **Project Proposal:** In the `Project_Proposal.pdf` file, you'll find our comprehensive proposal outlining the project's objectives and approach.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In the `EDA.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, we explore and visualize the datasets to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and churn trends.

3. **Feature Engineering and Model Building:** In the `feature_engineering.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, we preprocess the data, engineer new features, and build predictive models, including Random Forest.

4. **Interpretation and Insights:** Our findings and insights are documented in various markdown cells in the Jupyter Notebook files.

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
- Execute the Jupyter Notebooks in the specified order to understand our approach and findings.

## Project Disclaimer

This project is a simulation exercise and not associated with any real organization. It serves as a demonstration of our data analysis and machine learning skills.
